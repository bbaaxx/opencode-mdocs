> **Historical Note:** This document is the original design specification created *before* the plugin was implemented. It served as the blueprint for building opencode-mdocs. Some details may differ from the final implementation.

## Overview

An opencode plugin that implements a 2-layer knowledge system (initiatives + wiki) and enforces a 9-step workflow for AI-assisted development. The plugin is self-referential: its own development is tracked using its system.

## Architecture

**Approach: Plugin-Centric**

The plugin is the orchestrator. It owns the workflow state machine, enforces gates, and spawns subagents. Skills provide instructions, agents provide personas.

### Initiative File Format

Filename: `<slug>--<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (slug derived from title, descriptive and sortable)

```markdown
---
id: add-authentication-system
title: Add authentication system

- [2025-05-25] Implemented middleware (subagent: builder)

## Artifacts
- wiki/decisions/why-jwt.md

## Overview
The plugin follows a plugin-centric architecture...
```

### Indices

- `/mdocs/initiatives/INDEX.md` — auto-generated table of all initiatives with status, date, tags
- `/mdocs/wiki/INDEX.md` — auto-generated categorized list of all wiki entries
- `/mdocs/wiki/<category>/INDEX.md` — per-category index

Indices regenerated on every initiative/wiki write.

## Workflow State Machine

```
IDLE → UNDERSTAND → DISCOVER → CONTEXT → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → REPORT → COMPLETE
```

### Steps

1. **IDLE** — Waiting for request
2. **UNDERSTAND** — Clarify intent (may ask user questions if request is ambiguous)
3. **DISCOVER** — Scan `/mdocs/initiatives/` for related initiatives using fuzzy title matching (Levenshtein distance on slug words) and tag overlap (Jaccard similarity on tags array)
   - If match score > 0.6: offer to resume existing initiative
   - If not found: offer to create new initiative
4. **CONTEXT** — Read initiative file + related wiki entries, assemble context
5. **PLAN** — Create implementation plan, write to initiative
6. **EXECUTE** — Handoff to subagents via Task tool with assembled context
7. **VERIFY** — Check results (lint, typecheck, tests if available)
   - If not done: loop back to EXECUTE with feedback
   - If done: proceed
8. **REPORT** — Write wiki entries for artifacts, update initiative progress log
9. **COMPLETE** — Offer to commit changes, mark initiative as `done`

### Enforcement Rules

- Each step sets a checkpoint in `.workflow-state.json`
- `tool.execute.before` checks workflow state:
  - READ tools (read, glob, grep, list): always allowed
  - WRITE tools (edit, write): blocked until state >= PLAN
  - BASH tools: non-destructive commands (ls, cat, echo) always allowed; destructive commands (rm, mv, git commit) blocked until state >= COMPLETE
  - If workflow is IDLE (no active initiative), all tools allowed — workflow is opt-in per task
- Workflow state persisted in `/mdocs/.workflow-state.json`
- **Escape hatch:** If no active initiative exists (IDLE state), the workflow is opt-in — all tools work normally. Users opt into the workflow by creating or resuming an initiative.

## Plugin Hooks

```ts
export default (async ({ client, project, directory, $ }) => {
  const workflow = new WorkflowEngine(directory)
  const mdocs = new MdocsManager(directory)

  return {
    // Initialize /mdocs structure on first run
    config: (cfg) => {
      // Inject mdocs-orchestrator agent and skills into config
    },

    // Gate enforcement
    "tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
      // Block file edits if workflow state < PLAN
      // Block commits if workflow state < COMPLETE
      // Log tool calls to current initiative
    },

    // Track workflow progress
    "tool.execute.after": async (input, output) => {
      // Update initiative progress log after each step
    },

    // Permission integration
    "permission.ask": async (input) => {
      // Auto-allow tool calls that align with current workflow step
    },

    // Event bus for observability
    "event": (input) => {
      // Log significant events to initiative
    },

    // Custom tools
    tool: {
      mdocs_init: {
        description: "Initialize /mdocs folder structure",
        handler: async () => mdocs.init()
      },
      mdocs_status: {
        description: "Show current workflow state and active initiatives",
        handler: async () => workflow.status()
      }
    }
  }
}) satisfies Plugin
```

## Skills

### mdocs-workflow

- **Triggers:** "start work", "new task", "begin initiative", "work on"
- **Content:** Full 9-step workflow guide, how to read/write initiatives, how to query wiki, how to hand off to subagents

### mdocs-initiative

- **Triggers:** "create initiative", "update initiative", "initiative status"
- **Content:** Initiative file format, naming convention, status transitions, how to link wiki entries, how to generate INDEX.md

## Agent: mdocs-orchestrator

```yaml
---
description: Orchestrates work using the mdocs initiative/wiki workflow.
mode: primary
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
---
You are a workflow orchestrator. When given a task:
1. Understand the request (ask questions if unclear)
2. Check /mdocs/initiatives/ for related work
3. Read context from initiative + wiki
4. Create a plan
5. Dispatch subagents with assembled context
6. Verify results
7. Report to wiki, update initiative
8. Offer to commit
```

## Subagent Integration

The plugin assembles context for Task tool handoffs:

```ts
async function assembleContext(initiative, wikiEntries) {
  return {
    initiative: readInitiative(initiative),
    wikiContext: wikiEntries.map(e => readWikiEntry(e)),
    currentStep: workflow.getCurrentStep(),
    constraints: getConstraintsForStep(workflow.getCurrentStep())
  }
}
```

Subagent prompts include:
- Initiative objective and plan
- Relevant wiki entries
- Current step constraints
- Verification criteria

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g opencode-mdocs
```

### opencode.json

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-mdocs"],
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["node_modules/opencode-mdocs/skills"]
  },
  "agent": {
    "mdocs-orchestrator": "node_modules/opencode-mdocs/agents/mdocs-orchestrator.md"
  }
}
```

## Bootstrap Behavior

First time the plugin loads, if `/mdocs` doesn't exist:
1. Create `/mdocs/initiatives/` and `/mdocs/wiki/` directories
2. Create `/mdocs/initiatives/INDEX.md` and `/mdocs/wiki/INDEX.md`
3. Create first initiative: `install-and-configure-opencode-mdocs--<today>.md`
4. This initiative tracks the plugin's own installation (self-referential / dogfooding)

## Self-Referential Design

The plugin's own development is tracked as an initiative. The wiki documents:
- How the plugin works (architecture decisions)
- How to contribute (development runbooks)
- Why certain design choices were made

This proves the system works and serves as living documentation.
